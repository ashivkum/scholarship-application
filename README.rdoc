== Scholarship Application

As another practice project for Rails, this is a mock scholarship application to brush off some dust off my rails skills and solidify my understanding of the MVC framework concept. Since I've primarily been working on javascript, objects, arrays, and all that jazz the past few months, I plan on doing a bit of that in this app to showcase what I've learned to apply it in a practical context.

More to come.
